					(Come on)

					You get the limo out front
					Hottest styles, every shoe, every color

					Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
					It's really you but no one ever discovers
					Who would of thought that a girl like me
					Would double as a superstar

					You get the best of both worlds
					Chill it out, take it slow
					Then you rock out the show

					You get the best of both worlds
					Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds
