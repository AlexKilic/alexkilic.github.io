				(from "Hannah Montana" soundtrack)

				Oh yeah
				Come on

				You get the limo out front
				Hottest styles, every shoe, every color

				Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
				It's really you but no one ever discovers

				In some ways you're just like all your friends
				But on stage you're a star

				You get the best of both worlds
				Chill it out, take it slow
				Then you rock out the show

				You get the best of both worlds
				Mix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds</p>
